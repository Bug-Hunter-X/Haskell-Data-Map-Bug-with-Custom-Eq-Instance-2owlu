This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and the interaction between `Data.Map` and custom equality types.  The problem arises when using a custom `Eq` instance that's not strictly consistent with the intended semantics of the keys used in the `Data.Map`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug issues, as the map might not behave as expected due to seemingly equal keys actually being distinct under the map's internal comparison. For example:

```haskell
data MyKey = MyKey {-
    getKey :: Int -
}

instance Eq MyKey where
  (MyKey a) == (MyKey b) = a `mod` 10 == b `mod` 10

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let myMap = Data.Map.fromList [(MyKey 1, "one"), (MyKey 11, "eleven")]
  print (Data.Map.lookup (MyKey 1) myMap) -- Output: Just "one"
  print (Data.Map.lookup (MyKey 11) myMap) -- Output: Just "eleven"
  print (Data.Map.lookup (MyKey 21) myMap) -- Output: Just "eleven"  -- Unexpected
```
In this instance, `MyKey 1`, `MyKey 11`, and `MyKey 21` are all considered equal according to the custom `Eq` instance because their remainders when divided by 10 are the same.  Thus, they may not be handled as distinct keys, even when different values are associated with them.
