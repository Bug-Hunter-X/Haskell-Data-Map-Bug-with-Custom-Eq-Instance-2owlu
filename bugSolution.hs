```haskell
data MyKey = MyKey {
    getKey :: Int
}

instance Eq MyKey where
  (MyKey a) == (MyKey b) = a == b -- Fixed: Strict equality

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let myMap = Data.Map.fromList [(MyKey 1, "one"), (MyKey 11, "eleven")]
  print (Data.Map.lookup (MyKey 1) myMap) -- Output: Just "one"
  print (Data.Map.lookup (MyKey 11) myMap) -- Output: Just "eleven"
  print (Data.Map.lookup (MyKey 21) myMap) -- Output: Nothing -- Correct
```
By changing the `Eq` instance to use strict equality (`a == b`), we ensure that keys are uniquely identified, resolving the unexpected behavior.  Always thoroughly consider the implications of custom `Eq` and `Ord` instances when working with data structures that rely on them for ordering and comparison.
